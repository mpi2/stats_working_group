\section{CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0.1}{
PhenData is an R package that allows easy access to the phenotyping data produced by the International Mouse 
Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC).  For more information about the IMPC project, please visit 
\url{http://www.mousephenotype.org}.   
The idea of PhenData is to systematically explore the IMPC dataset's multiple dimensions until the correct 
combination of filters has been selected and then the data of interest downloaded.
